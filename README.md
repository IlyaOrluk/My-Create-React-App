# Greate Start React

Hello World!

Greate Start React is a simple starting point for Single Page Apps using React, Babel, and Webpack.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

To start the server and start hacking, run

```BASH
npm start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` should cause pages to reload.

## Static Assets

Static Assets are served from the `/public` folder.

## Styling

Stylesheets are bundled along with project files in the `.src` folder, so you can divide your stylesheets by component (or any other configuration you plan)

## Bundling

To bundle your files, run

```BASH
npm run build
```
